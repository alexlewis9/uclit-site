# Welcome to the UC LIT website repository

## How do I update the information on the pages?
This website is generated from a combination of 
- the information in the `.yml` files under the [`/_data/`](_data/) folder.
- the HTML files included in the various folders like [`/about/history.html`](about/history.html)

If the section you want to update is any of the following, [here](Docs/not-webmaster.md) are the instructions to update each.

|Section|
| -- |
|[President's Message](_data/presidents-message.yml)|
|[Documents](_data/documents.yml)|
|[The Council](_data/council.yml)|
|[Intramurals](_data/intramurals.yml)|

### The section I want to update isn't listed there
