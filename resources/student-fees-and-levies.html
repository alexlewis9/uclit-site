<p>
In accordance with the Governing Council's updated Policy of Recognition of Student Groups (June 25, 2020) and the Policy for Compulsory Non-Academic Incidental Fees (Sept. 23, 2003), the University College Literary and Athletic Society levies specific fees from registered students of University College. These fees contribute to specific areas of the Society's work, and often include special consideratons on use defined in the Council Policy. The fees which the Society collects are:
  The Society Fee, collected in a general fund available for student initiatives and Council events.
  The Association of College Programs Union Fee, collected in a general fund for use in intercollegiate Faculty events.
  The Charity Fund Levy, collected for use by the Equity Commission and donated to a not-for-profit charity of their choosing.
  The Contact UC Levy, collected for use by the Off-Campus Commission to create programming designed to engage commuter students with the college.
  The Gargoyle Levy, collected for use by the UC Gargoyle, a Society ancilliary organization, and the College's student newspaper.
  The Special (Capital) Fund Levy, collected for use by the Society but held in trust by the College administration for projects and objects identified by both parties as being crucial to their future operations.
  The Special Project Levy, collected for use by the Society and held in trust by the College administration for the revitalization of the central College building and its quad.
  The UC Follies Theatre Troupe Levy, collected for use by the UC Follies, a Society ancilliary organization, and the College's theatre society.
  The UC Review Levy, collected for use by the UC Review, a Society ancilliary organization, and the College's literary and artistic review journal.
  The WUSC Committee Levy, collected for use by the Society's committee on the World University Service of Canada, a Society ancilliary organization, and the College's local branch of the national organization.
  The WUSC Program Levy, collected for use by the WUSC Committee and disbursed in understanding with the College administration to finance its WUSC program.
Many of our fees are pegged to the Ontario Consumer Price Index (CPI), and following referenda, change to reflect fluctuations in the Province's economy. Our most recent change fee change included an increase to our Society Fee (see below), which successfully passed its referendum in April 2020. For the most up-to-date cost breakdowns by fee, please see your invoice, which can be found on ACORN.

<h3 class="font-secondary text-primary">Use, Refunds and Referenda</h3
<p>
Fees are held by the University administration and disbursed at multiple points throughout the year to the Society, however its use is strictly mandated by our Governing Documents, which follows a rigid schedule. There are two budget periods where Council members will submit budget request forms in accordance with the Society's Policies on Finance (Chapters 12 and 13, Council Policy), beginning in October and running to April (The Annual Budget), and from April to October (The Summer Budget).
Every fee listed above is compulsory for students of University College except for the Association of College Program Unions Fees, as per a student referendum. Any UC student may choose to submit a reimbursement request for this fee, which will be processed and disbursed in due time. If you would like to do so, please fill out the R-1 form, which can be found in the adjacent link, and send it to <a href="mailto:finance@uclit.ca">finance@uclit.ca</a>.
Students, regardless of whether they refund their ACPU fee, will be considered Members of the Society.
