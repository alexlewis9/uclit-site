# How to Commit Your Changes

### Updating files

0. First, ensure that you are signed in as uclit-webmaster. This is the github user that can make changes to this repository (a.k.a. any of these files), other users can only *request* to make changes.

1. Find the correct page you'd like to edit in github (either from the table [here](Docs/not_webmaster) or otherwise), and click the edit button in the top right.

2. Make your changes in the online github file editor.
3. After you make your changes, scroll down to the commit section. 
    * For the Commit Message, enter a short descriptive message explaining the updated you're making. 
    * Make sure "Commit directly to the master branch" is selected.
    * Click "Commit Changes"
    
      ![commit changes](/Docs/screenshots/commit_changes.png "commit directly to the master branch")

After a couple seconds, the website will be rebuilt and your changes will be visible at uclit.ca.

### Adding files
Sometimes, you'll need to add new files like headshots for new council members. 
To upload new files, follow the steps below.
0. First, ensure that you are signed in as uclit-webmaster.
1. Find the correct folder that you'd like to add files to. 
    * If you're adding images to a page that already has them (e.g. council), check where the other pictures are held and add the files to the same [headshots folder](/assets/images/headshots/).
    * If you're adding files to a page that never had any, typically we hold all of them in the [assets folder](/assets/). It's strongly recommended to keep the assets folder well-organized, and keep [images](/assets/images/) and [documents](/assets/documents) separate, and further sort them into their own categorical folders.
2. Once you've found the right folder to add the file to, click the plus button to upload files.

3. Scroll down to the commit section. 
    * For the Commit Message, enter a short descriptive message explaining the updated you're making. 
    * Make sure "Commit directly to the master branch" is selected.
    * Click "Commit Changes"
