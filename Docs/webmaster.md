This site is built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. Basically it lets you create a static site really easily, without having a bunch of repeated code (ex: for the page headers and footers, or repeating elements like council member photos) by splitting them up into their own components and calling them in the individual pages.

Jekyll also lets you pull data from `.yml` files and generate content for the site from it.
