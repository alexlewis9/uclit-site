  <p>UofT's Intramural Program provides an opportunity for students to play on their college's sports teams, fostering friendly competition between students across campus. Competing in intramurals is one of the easiest ways to get involved in the UC community. If you would like to join a UC intramural team or compete in one of the singles sports, please fill out the form below.</p> 
 
 <p><strong> Registration for Fall 2021 UC Intramurals is now open!</strong></p>
  <p><strong> Registration for Flag Football, Ice Hockey, Soccer, and Ultimate Frisbee will CLOSE ON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14th AT 11:59PM. Registration for Badminton, Basketball, Table Tennis, Tennis, and Volleyball will close on CLOSE ON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21st AT 11:59PM. After these dates, you must email athletics@uclit.ca to check availability for teams, you must email <a href="mailto:athletics@uclit.ca">athletics@uclit.ca</a> to check availability. </strong></p>
  <p> CAPTAIN applications will close September 14th at 11:59pm for all sports. You will still be permitted to register for sports, however no captain applications after this date will be considered. </p>
  <p>This year, there is NO classified Men's Division. Instead, the division has replaced by the OPEN DIVISION. While the majority of these players in the Open Division are expected to be male-identifying, it allows for non-male identifying players to join the team without needing to apply for an exception. The Open Division is <strong>NOT</strong> the Coed Division which has required amounts for players of specific genders. </p>   
  <p> The game times listed below are for all levels of each division. After you are registered for a specific team, your captain will provide you with your team's specific game schedule. If you have a time conflict with your game schedule, UC Athletics will try to move you to a team that works for you AFTER schedules are finalized. </p>
      <p>Sports available for the year are:</p>
  <p class="mb-0"><strong>OPEN</strong></p>
  
  <ul><li><strong>Basketball</strong> - Tuesday or Wednesday nights</li></ul>
  <ul><li><strong>Flag Football</strong> - Sunday afternoons</li></ul>

  <p>Players are more than welcome to sign up for multiple UC intramural teams or sports, however, separate forms are required for each sport.</p>

  <p>Players who attend all games of a team will receive a perfect attendance medal. Captains will receive CCR recognition.</p> 

  <p><strong>If you register for a UC intramural team or sport, please note that you take on the responsibility to avoid defaulting games as much as possible. A team/athlete “defaults” if one of the following happens: </strong></p>
  <p> -No one from UC shows up to compete </p>
  <p> -Not enough players from the UC team show up to compete </p>
  <p> -Too many players at once of one specific gender for coed (for example, four female players on the court during a coed volleyball game when there is a maximum of three per gender)</p>
