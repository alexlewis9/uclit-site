  <p>UofT's Intramural Program provides an opportunity for students to play on their college's sports teams, fostering friendly competition between students across campus. Competing in intramurals is one of the easiest ways to get involved in the UC community. If you would like to join a UC intramural team or compete in one of the singles sports, please fill out the form below.</p> 

  <p>Players are more than welcome to sign up for multiple UC intramural teams or sports, however, separate forms are required for each sport.</p>

  <p>All sports will run from the end of September until November.</p>

  <p>Players who attend all games of a team will receive a perfect attendance medal. Captains will receive CCR recognition.</p>
