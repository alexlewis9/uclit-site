#           Training with the UCDBC is not merely about winning; paddlers not only gain mental and physical strength, but are also

#           true: the UCDBC is a one-of-a-kind family.

          The University College Dragon Boat Club (UCDBC) is a competitive dragon boat racing club that is built upon passion, drive and resilience. The club has grown dramatically since its time of inception as the UC Dragon Boat Team in 1998. It evolved to the UC Water Dragons after it gained its competitive edge amongst local university teams.

          Today, the UCDBC contains 2 boats, the UC Water Dragons and the UC Hydras that compete in local and national regattas each summer. From our humble beginnings almost two decades ago, to competing amongst the nation’s top university teams today, our vision of success have remained the same. Our priority is to cultivate an environment that is accepting and fosters growth for athletes of all levels.

          Training with the UCDBC is not merely about winning; paddlers not only gain mental and physical strength, but are also immersed in a bonding environment where they belong. While the team grows even more, one thing will remain undoubtedly true: the UCDBC is a one-of-a-kind family.

        Our organization does hands-on volunteer work in Toronto. We participate in a broad range of volunteering activities, such as helping out at missions, food banks and soup kitchens. We host multiple volunteering activities a month, a weekly soup kitchen on Sunday evenings and advertise other opportunities for volunteering on our Facebook page.

        Our goal is to inform UC students about the various volunteer opportunities in the city. By making these volunteer opportunities more accessible, we hope to bring the spirit of volunteerism and community engagement to UC.

        Established in 1954, “the Garg” is University College’s greasiest student newspaper and publishes every two weeks. We are a paper that believes sometimes you should be angry, and sometimes you should be loud, and if you have not had a voice before, you deserve a voice. We don’t give print space to bigots and we don’t feign neutrality on issues of social justice.
