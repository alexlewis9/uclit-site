          The University College Dragon Boat Club (UCDBC) is a competitive dragon boat racing club that is built upon passion,
          drive and resilience. The club has grown dramatically since its time of inception as the UC Dragon Boat Team in 1998.
          It evolved to the UC Water Dragons after it gained its competitive edge amongst local university teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the UCDBC contains 2 boats, the UC Water Dragons and the UC Hydras that compete in local and national regattas
          each summer. From our humble beginnings almost two decades ago, to competing amongst the nation’s top university teams
          today, our vision of success have remained the same. Our priority is to cultivate an environment that is accepting and
          fosters growth for athletes of all levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Training with the UCDBC is not merely about winning; paddlers not only gain mental and physical strength, but are also
          immersed in a bonding environment where they belong. While the team grows even more, one thing will remain undoubtedly
          true: the UCDBC is a one-of-a-kind family.

          Girl Up is a global leadership development initiative, positioning girls to be leaders in the movement for gender equality. With resources in five languages and more than 2,200 Girl Up Clubs in over 100 countries, we’ve trained 40,000 girls of all backgrounds to create tangible change for girls everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Girl Up provides leadership training and gives girls tools to become gender equality advocates and activists. Through our programs, girls broaden their social impact skill set, receive a platform to tell their stories, and apply STEM for social good. Our girl leaders create real policy change at local and national levels, raise millions of dollars to support United Nations programs that reach tens of thousands of girls around the world, and build community-based movements.

        Our organization does hands-on volunteer work in Toronto. We participate in a broad range of volunteering activities, such as helping out at missions, food banks and soup kitchens. We host multiple volunteering activities a month, a weekly soup kitchen on Sunday evenings and advertise other opportunities for volunteering on our Facebook page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to inform UC students about the various volunteer opportunities in the city. By making these volunteer opportunities more accessible, we hope to bring the spirit of volunteerism and community engagement to UC.

        and publishes every two weeks. We are a paper that believes sometimes you should be 
        angry, and sometimes you should be loud, and if you have not had a voice before, 
        you deserve a voice. We don’t give print space to bigots and we don’t feign neutrality 
        on issues of social justice.

        The UC Follies is University College’s student-driven theatre troupe, entertaining
        University of Toronto’s St. George Campus community for over 100 years with one simple
        goal: to provide an inclusive space for students to bring their talents outside of 
        the classroom, and onto the stage. The UC Follies was officially inaugurated in 1924,
        and has since become one of the University’s largest student theatre groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UC Follies’ origins date back to mock parliaments that were being performed around
        campus in the late 1880s. From classical to contemporary, from plays to comedies to 
        musicals, the UC Follies produces variety of professional-quality shows throughout the 
        school year and summer season, and contains a sketch comedy troupe. With plenty roles 
        to fill, both onstage and off, the UC Follies has many opportunities for students to 
        get involved.
