  <p>On this page you can find all relevant information about our bi-annual elections, which are run in accordance with the Provostial Policy on Open, Accessible and Democratic Autonomous Student Organizations and the Society <a href="https://uclit.ca/resources/documents">Policies on Hiring</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Our early Fall general election selects our First Year Representative cohort and in the Winter term, we elect our Executive, and Middle and Upper Year Representatives. At anytime between March and January, there may also be Special By-Elections as necessary. Any UC student in good academic standing is eligible to run in our elections; feel free to explore the positions in the position information button below, and check out our work-in-progress results archive to learn about past elections. If you have any questions whatsoever, don't hesitate to send an email to the <a href="mailto:elections@uclit.ca">Elections Coordinator</a>!</p>
  
  <p>This election will be held entirely online following collegiate, university, provincial, and federal guidlines on best practices for COVID-19 prevention and general environmental health and safety guidelines. The 2021 Spring Elections Code contains special provisions considering the use of digital campaigning, and there will be no election bond held in trust.</p>
  
  <p>Nomination forms must first be submitted to the Elections Coordinator by email during the Nomination Period with the name and student number of a current full or part-time student who will be seconding your nomination. Following your submission, ten (10) other full or part-time students will need to submit their intent to nominate via email before the period finishes to achieve a valid nomination!</p><br>
