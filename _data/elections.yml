At anytime between March and January, there may also be Special By-Elections as necessary. Any UC student in good academic standing is eligible to run in our elections; feel free to explore the positions in the position information button below, and check out our work-in-progress results archive to learn about past elections.

  <p>This election will be held entirely online following collegiate, university, provincial, and federal guidlines on best practices for COVID-19 prevention and general environmental health and safety guidelines. The 2021 Fall Elections Code contains special provisions considering the use of digital campaigning, and there will be no election bond held in trust.</p>
  
  <p>The first step is submitting a nomination form. Nomination forms, which include the information of a valid seconder and ten (10) UC full- or part-time student nominees, must be submitted to the <a href="mailto:elections@uclit.ca">Elections Coordinator</a> before the conclusion of the Nomination Period!</p>

  <p>All valid nominees (those who have been seconded and received ten (10) nominations) will be invited to join the election. There will be a <strong>mandatory</strong> all-candidates meeting with the Elections Coordinator to review the rules and guidelines of the election. Inattendance will lead to disqualification. Following this meeting, the Campaigning Period will begin, and candidates may begin their personal campaigns in accordance with the Elections Code. There will be a two-day Voting Period at the conclusion of the Campaiging Period, after which any nominees who have received the majority or plurality of their election pool will be offered to Council for ratification of their Office.</p>
