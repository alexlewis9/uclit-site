  <p>This election will be held entirely online following collegiate, university, provincial, and federal guidlines on best practices for COVID-19 prevention and general environmental health and safety guidelines. The 2021 Spring Elections Code contains special provisions considering the use of digital campaigning, and there will be no election bond held in trust.</p>
  
  <p>The first step is submitting a nomination form. Nomination forms must first be submitted to the Elections Coordinator by email during the Nomination Period with the name and student number of a current full or part-time student who will be seconding your nomination. Following your submission, ten (10) other full or part-time students will need to submit their intent to nominate via email before the period finishes to achieve a valid nomination!</p>

  <p>All valid nominees (those who have been seconded and received ten (10) nominations) will be invited to join the election. There will be a <strong>mandatory</strong> all-candidates meeting with the Elections Coordinator to determine the rules and guidelines of the election. Inattendance will lead to disqualification. Following this meeting, the Campaigning Period will begin, and candidates may begin their personal campaigns in accordance with the Elections Code. There will be a two-day Voting Period at the conclusion of the Campaiging Period, after which any nominees who have received the majority or plurality of their election pool will be offered to Council for ratification of their Office.</p>
