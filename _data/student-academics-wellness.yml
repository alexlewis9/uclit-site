  text: |
    My Student Support Program (MySSP) provides University of Toronto students with immediate and/or ongoing confidential, 24-hour support for any school, health, or general life concern at no cost to students. You can call or chat with a counsellor directly from your phone whenever, wherever you are for a range of concerns. Students who use MySSP still have access to existing campus and community mental health services; MySSP is an additional support service.
    Download the MySSP app: Apple App Store | Google Play and keep reading so that you understand what to expect.
    You can also access the service 24/7 by calling 1-844-451-9700. Outside of North America, call 001-416-380-6578.
    The resources which follow are not affiliated with the University of Toronto, but are online mental health resources (either as a temporary measure during the pandemic, or typically) which students can access using their coverage by the University Health Insurance Plan, OHIP, or with private insurance. They are notably low-cost mental health services in and around the  GTA. If a service is geared towards a certain age range, gender, ethnicity, or some other group identity, it will be noted.
    Some services require an appointment, and others have walk-ins available.
    The University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP) administered by the UTSU is covering virtual appointments made by healthcare practitioners which the plan covers. Please read about it in their COVD-19 update here.
    The UHIP covers up  to fifteen (15) sessions in a policy year (Sept. 1, 2019 – Aug. 31, 2020), up to $100 a session. Any counsellor is qualified to be covered by UHIP within these limits so long as  they hold either a MSW (Master’s of Social Work) or are a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical counsellor, or both. This information can be found on the practitioner’s website or through contacting their office.
    If you have undergone a counselling session in the above policy year, you can still submit your claims to Desjardins; get in touch if you need help below. The new policy year will go into effect on September 1st, 2020, renewing the fifteen (15) sessions and coverage provided by UHIP.
    Additionally, the Studentcare Psychology Network offers video appointments through the PsyVitalitï partnership, which has a reduced cost in addition to UHIP coverage; both apply.
    All of the information in the above paragraph can be found here.
    For information on how to make your insurance claim for these appointments, visit here, or contact the UCLit here for tips on making your claim.
