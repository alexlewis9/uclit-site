  For over one hundred and fifty years, our council has represented students at UC, and this year will prove no different. We remain absolutely committed to advocating for just causes, supporting our college spirit, and engaging our community no matter what difficulties we encounter. Though we cannot meet in person just yet, I hope to see each of you at our online events, workshop initiatives, and meetings this year. Get in touch if ever you need anything, and together we can shed some light on the many unknowns we have in our lives these days.
