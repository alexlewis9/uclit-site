  <p>UofT's Intramural Program provides an opportunity for students to play on their college's sports teams, fostering friendly competition between students across campus. Competing in intramurals is one of the easiest ways to get involved in the UC community. If you would like to join a UC intramural team or compete in one of the singles sports, please fill out the form below.</p> 

<p>Players are more than welcome to sign up for multiple UC intramural teams or sports, however, separate forms are required for each sport.</p>

<p>All sports will run from the end of September until November.</p>

<p>Players who attend all games of a team will receive a perfect attendance medal. Captains will receive CCR recognition.</p> 

<p>Please note that if you register for an open singles or e-sports singles sport that you will not be part of a formal UC intramural "team". You will represent UC but compete individually against other students representing their own colleges and faculties. This may include other UC students.</p>

<p>If you register for an open doubles sport you are free to partner with a student from another college/faculty as long as you indicate that below. Both partners must register for intramurals through their respective college/faculty.</p>
 
 <p class="mb-0"><strong> ***Registration will CLOSE ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16th AT 11:59PM. After this date, you must email athletics@uclit.ca to check availability for this team.
