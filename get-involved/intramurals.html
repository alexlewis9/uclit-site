<p>The easiest way to get active and involved at UC is by playing Intramural Sports. The UC intramural teams ( The UC
  Gryphons ) are a force to be reckoned with by all the other colleges at UofT. Our Intramural Sports programs seek to
  fulfill the needs of athletes and sports enthusiasts of all types. We try to provide them with as many sports and
  skill levels that we can.</p>

<p>Please note that upon signing up for teams the captain will be sending out emails regarding tryouts or practices.
  Please show up to these tryouts or notify the captain if you are no longer interested.
